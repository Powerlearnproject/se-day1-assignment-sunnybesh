#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Softwre engineering is a systematic approach of designining, implementing, testing, deploying and maintaining software. it involves understanding user requirements, writing code, ensuring quality throuh testing, fixing errors in the code,maintenance and upgrade of the software. it's importance in the technology industry are:
1. PROMOTES INNOVATION: software engineering helps promote innovation and creative problem solving by creating new applications, products and services that solves societal problems.
2. ENSURES RELIABILITY: Standard practices leads to stable software, reduction in errors or crashes. this is important for critical applications like healthcare, finance and transportation.
3. IMPROVES SCALABILITY AND ADAPTABILITY: The principles of software engineering allow for scalable and adaptable solutions depending of need and size of demand
4.ENHANCES EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE: Application of software engineering principles helps design software that is optimally functional, efficient, faster and better user interface and experiencwes. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming language: high level programming language like fotran and C was developed
2. Establishment of software enginering as a discipline in the 1960s. this brought to the fore the importance of software engineering.
3. advent of structured programming in the 1970s. this revolutionalizes the field of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: gathering and documenting the system needs of the user
2. Design: using high level programming language to design the software architexture and interface.
3. implementation: writing the code and building the software according to design specifications
4. Testing: conducting to ensure the software meets standards in terms of quality and functional requrements
5. Deployment: release of the software to the market, consumers or users.
6. maintenance:Providing support to users, enhancement, upgrading of software for improved performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a step by step sequential approach thaat is unidirectional while the agile methodology is uses an iterative method and is dynamic allowing for flexibility and collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: responsible for writting codes and implementoing software solutions
2. QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: responsible for testing the software to ensures it meets quality standards
3. PROJECT MANAGER: oversees the planning, implementation and delivery of software solutions.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment is a platform with comprehensive tools for writting, debugging and testing of a code e.g Visual studio
A version control environment provides software tools for tracking changes inthe source code, synchronising and coordinating work among team members. E.g Git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges are:
1. Changing requirements during the development cycle that may lead to creep and project delays
2. tight deadlines leading to rush development which may compromise quality
3. technical debt accrued from shortcut or suboptimal solutions.
These challenges can be overcomed through:
1. effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. prioritization of tasks
4. regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit: this involves testing the individual components or moules of a system. It helps to catch bugs early and ensure reliable building blocks of the software.
2. integration: verifies that the software components function together directly. It ensures seamless collaboration among components
3. System: validates the entire system against specified requirements. Confirms that the software meets it intended purpose.
4. Acceptance:Performed by users or stakeholders to validate if the software meets business needs. Ensures alignment with user expectations and business goals.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering involves designing and refining prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. Think of it as asking the right questions to get the best answers. The way a prompt is phrased significantly influences the AI’s output. Effective prompt engineering ensures precision, relevance, and coherence in interactions with technology.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Original: “Tell me about cars.”
Why it’s vague: It lacks specificity. What aspect of cars does the user want to know about? Types, history, mechanics?
Improved Prompt: “Describe the history and major types of electric cars.”
Why it’s better: The improved prompt specifies the topic (electric cars) and the desired information (history and types), making it more effective for generating relevant content.
